  abstract={This study examines how different types of financial frictions influence household wealth and consumption inequality in response to a contractionary monetary policy shock. The analysis considers two key frictions: those affecting production firms and those related to household borrowing, both incorporated into a HANK model. The results suggest that frictions in the productive sector have a stronger impact on wealth inequality, whereas frictions in household borrowing lead to greater consumption dispersion relative to the counterfactual scenario. This divergence primarily arises from dynamics around the zero-wealth threshold, particularly the behavior of the household borrowing spread.},
