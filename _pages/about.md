I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Salerno.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Sapienza University of Rome. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2024. During my doctoral studies, I was also a visiting scholar at the Barcelona School of Economics.

My research interests include **macroeconomics**, **monetary policy**, **heterogeneous agents models**, **financial frictions** and **inflation expectations**.
