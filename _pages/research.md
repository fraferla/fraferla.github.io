This study investigates the redistribution effects of a contractionary conventional monetary policy shock on households within a HANK framework that incorporates financial frictions in the production sector of the economy. The findings reveal that the financial accelerator also acts as an “inequality accelerator,” indicating that the financial structure of productive firms plays an important role in shaping the distribution of wealth and consumption among households. Additionally, I show that financial frictions amplify wealth changes not only withinhouseholds but also across household types, namely workers and rentiers.

Does the location of financial frictions significantly change the distributional consequences of monetary policy? Using a HANK model, I compare transmission under firm-side and household-side financial accelerators. I document a state-dependent trade-off: while firm-side frictions amplify wealth inequality by depressing labor income, household-side frictions generate a significantly larger spike in consumption inequality. This divergence is driven by the behavior of the household borrowing spread and its impact on agents near the zero-wealth threshold. Under firm frictions, households use credit to smooth indirect income shocks; under household frictions, rising spreads directly choke off liquidity, trapping a larger share of agents in hand-to-mouth status. These findings highlight that the ``inequality cost" of monetary policy depends critically on the specific origin of credit market stress
